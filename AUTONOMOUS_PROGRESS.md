# Autonomous Progress

## Feature 2.4 — Ad claim candidates

- Branch: `feature/primary-product-claims`
- Commit: `3d3cf61a5624e499c7fa13c6d5c081d51f5ec7a4`
- Goal: Deterministically project researched specs and features into selectable, source-linked ad claims.
- Main files: `ad_claims.py`, `tests/test_ad_claims.py`
- Tests added: 15 focused candidate-model, formatting, provenance, ordering, compatibility, and collision tests.
- Total tests: 72 passing.
- Real-world regression: The seven Soundcore candidates matched expected IDs and display text; all retained confidence `0.65`, `verified=false`, and TWS context.
- Design decision: Candidates are transient typed projections with product-relative IDs and deep-copied evidence; `Product` remains unchanged.
- Known limitation: Candidate IDs track semantic slots, not historical values; future audited campaigns may need snapshots.
- Next selected feature: Deterministic ad claim selection resolution without Campaign persistence.

## Feature 2.5 — Ad claim selection resolution

- Branch: `feature/primary-product-claims`
- Commit: `0a864059033e9de4e877ae45fef14979568a9dd8`
- Goal: Resolve selected candidate IDs safely without introducing Campaign persistence.
- Main files: `ad_claims.py`, `tests/test_ad_claims.py`
- Tests added: 7 focused selection-order, validation, collision, and mutation-isolation tests.
- Total tests: 79 passing.
- Real-world regression: A reversed Soundcore selection resolved to stable product source order while retaining TWS context, confidence, and verification state.
- Design decision: Selection resolution rejects unknown or duplicate IDs and returns deep copies in candidate source order.
- Known limitation: The selected ID list is not yet bound to a product identity.
- Next selected feature: A minimal typed product-bound claim selection, without a Campaign model or persistence.

## Feature 2.6 — Product-bound ad claim selection

- Branch: `feature/primary-product-claims`
- Commit: `3e5173c9f98ca1642e6a4ba92772ce304f9ec64d`
- Goal: Bind selected candidate IDs to one Product without creating Campaign persistence.
- Main files: `ad_claims.py`, `tests/test_ad_claims.py`
- Tests added: 6 focused model-validation, product-binding, resolution, and mutation-safety tests.
- Total tests: 85 passing.
- Real-world regression: A JSON-round-tripped Soundcore selection resolved the expected three candidates with confidence, verification state, and TWS context intact.
- Design decision: Store only `product_id` and unique candidate IDs; regenerate selected claims from current Product research truth.
- Known limitation: Selections do not snapshot historical claim wording or evidence revisions.
- Next selected feature: None autonomously; remaining roadmap options require a material research-policy or broader domain-architecture decision.

## Feature 2.7 — Product identity normalization

- Branch: `feature/primary-product-claims`
- Commit: this commit
- Goal: Separate conservative product display names from deterministic source-scoped identity.
- Main files: `product_identity.py`, `product.py`, `product_research.py`, identity and compatibility tests, and one generic fixture.
- Tests added: 29 focused name-normalization, URL identity, variant-scope, persistence, selection-compatibility, claim-ID, and integration regressions.
- Total tests: 114 passing.
- Real-world regression: The Soundcore page produced `source_name` with its source SEO title, canonical name `Select 4 Go`, group ID `soundcore-com-group-products-a31x1021`, no arbitrary variant, and the same four specs, three features, evidence methods, and seven ad candidate IDs.
- Design decision: New research IDs use same-origin canonical or final URLs with explicit entity scope; legacy saved Product/selection pairs retain and resolve their existing IDs unchanged.
- Known limitation: IDs remain source-scoped and are not reconciled across canonical URL changes or different retailers.
- Next selected feature: Evaluate the smallest conservative source or asset discovery prerequisite without collapsing research, claim, selection, or campaign boundaries.
